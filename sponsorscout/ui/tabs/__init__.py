"""Per-tab UI builders for SponsorScout (PySide6 restart).

The planned split documented by the Tkinter-era placeholder is now real:
each tab is a self-contained QWidget that receives its dependencies through
constructor arguments (db_path / coordinator / refresh callbacks), so tabs
can be reasoned about and tested in isolation.  ``ui/app.py`` only wires
them together.
